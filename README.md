## Assumptions

the only large assumption I made was that some of fishes didn't have an image attached, so i just picked a cute cartoon fish to replace it. I assume we will go over my though process in more depth at a later date.

## Running app

Download the repo and use npm install at the root to download all necessary packages. The only package downloaded that shouldn't see fairly normal is react router, which i used to create dyanmic routes for the regions.

After downloading this client, run ABR's server, then run this using `npm run start`.
